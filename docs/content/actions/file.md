### Open Source and Open Standard

The `Lapdev` core code is open sourced under the AGPL V3 license, with selected features gated under an Enterprise License.

Before Lapdev, we developed two other open source projects: a code editor Lapce and a native UI toolkit Floem.
Developer environment management software is a crucial component for enhancing developer velocities.
We would not have opted for proprietary software for this purpose ourselves, so it is only logical for us to open source the core code of Lapdev.

To sustain the development of our open source projects, we've introduced enterprise licensing for certain features.
This enables us to generate revenue that directly supports the ongoing enhancement of Lapdev and our broader open source initiatives.

Beyond open source, we also favour open standards.
We’ve adopted the devcontainer specification for the definition and configuration of the development environment.
The standard is already supported by popular tools like VSCode, Codespaces and Devpod.
We believe it’s beneficial for developers to have a single format to define their development environment as code,
and to be able to use it across different tools.
